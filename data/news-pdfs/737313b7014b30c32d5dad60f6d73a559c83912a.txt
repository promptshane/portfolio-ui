> Buy This 'Secret Sauce' Chip Business Before Tech Investors Do
>
> On November 3, a little-known tech stock quietly started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
>
> This company has no past public presence. So tech investors aren't covering it. Yet, it's a critical business with a long history and a clean balance sheet.
>
> That gives us a rare opportunity... We have a chance to get into a great business before Wall Street's technology investors know it exists.
>
> I'm not talking about a cross-listing from a foreign exchange or an initial public offering of a well-known tech unicorn.
>
> It's a tech firm that has been hidden for decades inside a legacy chemical firm. But last week, the company revealed its business to Wall Street. And soon, hundreds of millions of dollars in targeted tech investments will move into the stock. That's why I'm sending you this month's recommendation early.
>
> Let me explain...
>
> Introducing Qnity Electronics
>
> We're picky about how we add tech investments to our model portfolio.
>
> Essentially, we have four requirements:
>
> We want to see a company that's stable but growing sales... with a path for more upside.
> We want a company with trophy assets.
> We want talent – hundreds of geniuses, even thousands. Plus, we want patents.
> We don't want monsters under the bed – no hidden liabilities.
> Even for developmental companies, we want to know what their products could be worth – and when they might see sales.
>
> A third of our model portfolio tech picks hit the "genius" metric hard – like Analog Devices (Nasdaq: ADI), Moog (NYSE: MOGA), and Capcom (TSE: 9697). Another third has trophy assets in critical industries – like Intel (Nasdaq: INTC), Amkor Technology (Nasdaq: AMKR), and Austal (ASX: ASB).
>
> Another third has both: Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Bombardier (TSX: BBDB), MDA Space (TSX: MDA), Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (Nasdaq: KTOS), and BWX Technologies (NYSE: BWXT). Whether it's geniuses, trophy assets, or both, all these firms have long track records.
>
> Today's recommendation is no exception. It's a spinoff from DuPont de Nemours (DD), which sells advanced materials for health care, water purifiers, construction, and chipmaking. But the chipmaking division has now split apart from DuPont.
>
> I'm talking about Qnity Electronics (NYSE: Q).
>
> The "new" Qnity is a chemical and materials company serving silicon chipmakers globally.
>
> Chips are the brains of modern electronics. By 2030, chips will be a $1 trillion market. And Qnity's products are at the heart of chipmaking and chip packaging. So Qnity builds the "secret sauce" that makes modern electronics possible.
>
> For chipmaking, Qnity makes the masks cut by lasers to put "street maps" on chips. Qnity also makes the coatings that protect the chip as it's built during each process step. Qnity also makes slurries and pads that buff and wash the chip so it's pan-flat. These films and slurries were worth $1.3 billion in revenue during the first half of 2025. For the third quarter of 2025, this segment booked $700 million in sales. And it's up 11% year over year.
>
> For finished chips, Qnity makes wiring, etchable layers, plus insulation. In other words, Qnity helps firms like Intel or Amkor connect a chip onto a finished circuit board. Just as importantly, Qnity helps manage heat, with thermal gels and heat transfer plates.
>
> Chip packaging is constantly evolving, with more and smaller chips being put onto printed circuit boards. So Qnity is designing new layouts, new wiring, and better cooling materials.
>
> In the first half of 2025, Qnity sold $1 billion in its chip packaging unit. By the third quarter alone, this was up to $580 million. So packaging is growing even faster than chipmaking. It's a newly emerging cash cow.
>
> On November 1, Qnity spun out from DuPont as a separate, public company. Under the terms of the deal, Qnity paid DuPont a $4.2 billion special dividend. And existing DuPont shareholders received Q shares. Over the past several days, there have been millions of shares exchanged. At Friday's close, shares were around $92, giving Qnity a current market cap of $19 billion.
>
> But let's not forget the $4.2 billion special dividend payment Qnity paid DuPont. Qnity took out new debt to cover it. However, DuPont let Qnity keep $600 million in cash. (This cash balance is unaudited. Qnity will report the audited data shortly to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.)
>
> So Qnity's enterprise value (market capitalization plus net debt) is $22.5 billion. Let's compare that with Qnity's earnings...
>
> Qnity (within DuPont) made $500 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") in the first half of 2025. It made another $385 million in EBITDA for the third quarter. Looking forward, the company expects $1.4 billion in EBITDA for the full year... during which it was part of DuPont for 10 months.
>
> This gives us an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 16, which is acceptable for a company growing at 10% annually.
>
> But we think Qnity will grow a lot faster than 10% moving forward...
>
> Qnity's Factories, People, and Patents Are Worth $4.2 Billion
>
> Qnity's $4.2 billion payment to DuPont bought all the division's factories, including the people who work there, and all the tools. That's 39 factory sites in 13 countries, along with 8,000 trained factory workers. One-third of those workers are in the U.S. and Canada.
>
> Qnity also bought its 1,200-person research team along with their 20 office buildings. Plus, Qnity obtained the rights to 6,900 patents – with 80% of those issued. The other 20% are applications that have been accepted.
>
> This is a powerhouse of capital, labor, and intellectual property that took decades to build.
>
> And we think Qnity paid a fair price...
>
> DuPont had $11 billion in property, plant, and equipment in its 2024 annual report. DuPont also reported $12 billion in revenue. The Qnity division made one-third of that revenue and about one-third of the net profits for DuPont in 2024.
>
> So Qnity's reasonable share of DuPont's property, plant, and equipment is one-third of it all. That would be $3.6 billion in property, plant, and equipment.
>
> It's hard to value researchers, but to hire experts from scratch costs about $100,000 each. So that's another $120 million. Meanwhile, patents are worth $10,000 each, or $69 million. So what Qnity bought is worth at least $3.8 billion.
>
> This doesn't include DuPont's land costs. The dozens of factories aren't on vacant land. They're built in the right places to serve key customers. We figure that's worth 10% on top of $3.8 billion.
>
> Considering the cost to rebuild everything, we think Qnity's $4.2 billion payment is fair. Plus, rebuilding would take a decade. And you would still need customers to come. Thankfully, Qnity kept the 800 sales guys for its division in two dozen countries.
>
> Qnity still has competition. But its chemical and advanced materials factories are local to the chip fabs they serve, making its 39 global factories trophy assets.
>
> Despite all this, tech investors aren't following Qnity since it simply just appeared as a separate, tradable firm earlier this month. That gives us a rare opportunity...
>
> Reshoring
>
> We've been covering the U.S. and Europe's efforts to move chipmaking and packaging away from China and Taiwan over the past few years. They're spending tens of billions of dollars to build new chip fabs and chip packaging facilities in the U.S. and Europe.
>
> All these new fabs and factories will need films, masks, and slurries – the secret sauce that Qnity has provided for 30 years as part of DuPont. Around 80% of all chipmakers use Qnity's products.
>
> Just as important, Qnity's products are consumable – so the more chips and electronics boards you make, the more films, wiring, and insulation you need.
>
> If a China-Taiwan conflict breaks out, chipmakers outside these countries will need to run additional shifts. That means even more of Qnity's products to support more shifts of existing chip production lines.
>
> For example, Samsung is Qnity's single largest customer. It makes up 12% of Qnity's revenue. And Samsung's plants are in South Korea. So if a conflict does break out in Taiwan, Samsung could ramp up production at its plants. This is also true for earthquakes, typhoons, droughts, or anything that would take some chipmaking fabs offline.
>
> Getting in Before Wall Street
>
> Let's be clear about one thing – because Qnity spun out from DuPont, all the S&P 500 exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") already own Qnity since they held DuPont shares.
>
> ETF money managers don't even have to up their holdings in Qnity since the current split in market cap between Qnity (at $19.3 billion) and DuPont (at $16.6 billion) is a fair split of DuPont's presplit market capitalization.
>
> But there is a huge swath of investors who know nothing about Qnity and don't have it in their portfolios yet: tech investors. Qnity is essentially a debutant. So we think tech investors – from chip sector indexes to tech funds – will want to hold these shares.
>
> These shares are also somewhat rare because Qnity didn't have an initial public offering. The shares only hit the market as DuPont shareholders sell them, and ETF managers can't sell them because Qnity is part of the S&P 500.
>
> That's why we're telling you all this today. Qnity is a new tech stock with a secret 30-year history inside DuPont. It makes the secret sauce essential for chipmaking and chip packaging. It's growing at 10% per year – and that's before the reshoring in the U.S. and Europe is completed.
>
> Qnity is also effectively immune to global catastrophes since chips are essential – even during global pandemics.
>
> Best of all, though, every tech fund will want to add Qnity. All in all, we think the stock could easily double from here.
>
> We'll have a full write-up in our monthly issue. But for now, take a full position.
>
> ACTION TO TAKE
> Buy Qnity Electronics (NYSE: Q) up to $115 per share.
> As always, we won't set an initial stop loss. We recommend that you diversify your portfolio across several positions so you're not overexposed to just one company. As a rule, invest in at least 10 companies in the Venture Technologymodel portfolio. While some positions could experience catastrophic losses, others could achieve spectacular gains.
>
> We also emphasize position sizing... If you normally place $10,000 in a position with a 50% stop loss, go with a $5,000 position instead. This will keep a huge loss from representing too large of a portion of your overall portfolio.
>
> Please note, we will not plan on selling half if the stock doubles.
>
> Good investing,
