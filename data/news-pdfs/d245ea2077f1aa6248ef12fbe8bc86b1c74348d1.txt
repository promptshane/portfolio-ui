Sell Propy (PRO)
Dear reader,
The recent crypto sell-off has taken Propy (PRO) down with it – hitting our mental 50% stop loss. So it's time to sell.
Let me explain...
We recommended Propy in
September as part of the real estate revolution. Propy is an Ethereum-based real estate platform for buyers, sellers, and agents who want to automate and streamline many of the processes that go into buying and selling properties.
Propy leverages artificial intelligence and automated smart-contract technology to connect real estate agents and homeowners, facilitate 24-hour buying and selling with real-time notifications, track important documents like titles, and make contracts easier to read. It can also be used to complete escrow in as little as four minutes. So Propy can herald in a change of how real estate transactions are conducted.
However, the recent volatility in the crypto sector has sent many altcoins falling – including Propy.
Remember, we implemented a 50% stop loss on all new positions in August to help us weather crypto's ups and downs. While we're confident that blockchain's rapid advancements and growing worldwide adoption will eventually usher in a period of phenomenal growth, we also understand how important it is to trim positions that are unlikely to rebound quickly – if at all. We want to maximize our returns while minimizing our losses.
Now, with this strategy, there will still be times when we sell out of a position that goes on to rally. But if it helps us avoid losses 4 out of 5 times, it will be worth it. So while we still believe in Propy as a project, we need to follow our exit strategy and sell.
ACTION TO TAKE
Sell your Propy (PRO) position at market . You can put your proceeds into bitcoin (BTC), wrapped staked Ethereum (wstETH), PAX Gold (PAXG), or any coin rated "buy" in our model portfolio .
