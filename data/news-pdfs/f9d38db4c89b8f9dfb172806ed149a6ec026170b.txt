> Dear subscriber,
>
> We just released three research reports that you have access to today...
>
> The first covers a little-understood concept in the world of finance... a Cash Tsunami. It's what happens when investors stop hoarding cash on the sidelines and pour their money into the stock market.
>
> When a Cash Tsunami kicks off, much higher stock prices follow. It's really that simple.
>
> Right now, cash in money-market funds is sitting at historic highs. But even more important, the conditions are in place for that money to start to move... thanks to a few important catalysts.
>
> That's why I'm sharing the five recommendations that I believe are best positioned to soar as hundreds of billions of dollars flow into stocks.
>
> I'll explain everything in this report: "Never Bet Against America: Five Stocks That Could 5x in the Coming Melt Up <
>
> You have full access to this research as a True Wealth subscriber. Make sure you read it on our website right here <
>
> Our second idea is on the incredible rally in gold...
>
> Gold has boomed this year, hitting all-time high after all-time high. But the opportunity isn't over yet. By the time this boom ends, I believe gold will hit $8,000 an ounce.
>
> In my special report, "$8,000 Gold and Beyond < I'll cover this opportunity, including why silver could be an even bigger winner...
>
> I'll also share two one-click ways to profit from the boom in precious metals – and two more ideas that offer leveraged upside on rising metals prices.
>
> You can find the details right here <
>
> Finally, I'm sharing one hated idea that's critical to understand...
>
> The office market has been in a depression for years. But it's swinging from "bad to less bad" right now.
>
> That's the hallmark of a true contrarian setup. It's the point when you can get in for the biggest potential gains... because most folks still haven't noticed the turnaround that's underway.
>
> That's why I just released my special report, "Unexpected Profits: Surprise Gains and Income From a Forgotten Market < In it, I cover a real estate stock that checks all our boxes for a great contrarian investment.
>
> It's a textbook True Wealth opportunity. Again, you can read all the details on our website right here <
>
> Good investing,
